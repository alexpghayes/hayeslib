This package is for personal experimentation, inspired by Hilary Parker's [Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) post.

Currently the package is serving as a somewhat messy code and notes repository. I'm in the process of turning the code snippets into documented and tested functions.

trivial change to see if need to push again to get site to build

### Next steps
* Do fun `purrr::as_mapper` stuff
* Document and test current functions, clean up pkgdown site
* Rcpp MVN/dirichlet samplers/r/p/q functions, nicely parameterized t-dists
* `show_dir`: nicely output directory structure
* `combine`: type happiness?
* `perc`: vectors, and count/tally like
* `retype`: rename and type convert at once
* `replace_if`: if condition, replace with value, otherwise leave be, vectorized
* `count_if`: count when predicate occurs for tidyselected columns
* `ggpie`: upgrade to tidyeval handle labels better (i.e. just get them from a label column in the original data frame)
* `spread_keep_`: use same doc as `spread_keep`
* README: document functions that other people might find useful
* ALL THE BADGES
* Installation instructions
* Example usages
* How and when to use branches during package development (especially in case people actually end up using your code and you need things to be stable)
* Using the Github issues, projects, wiki ecosystem
* update gentle tidyeval: adding select/mutate semantics, cleanup, note that things may change, also maybe use tufte-esque blogdown theme
* `quo`/`sym` as per Hadley's tweet - i.e. prefix/suffix not necessary

### Less developed thoughts

fit univariate model on many different features
num_levels <- function(df, var) print(dim(distinct(df, !!enquo(var)))[1]), option filter out na
model_tibble wrapper
