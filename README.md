[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexpghayes/hayeslib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexpghayes/hayeslib) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/alexpghayes/hayeslib/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/alexpghayes/hayeslib?branch=master)

`hayeslib` is a personal package inspired by Hilary Parker's [Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) post.

`hayeslib` is a repository of code snippets that I find myself using frequently for common tasks (i.e. I want to use a function I wrote in more than one research report or problem set so I quickly through it in here).

Dear potential employers
========================

This is not what I think a R package should look like. At some point this I will turn the code here into well documented and tested functions. It's probably gonna be a while.

See the Issues tab if to see what I think this package should look like.

Installation
------------

You can install hayeslib from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexpghayes/hayeslib")
```

Example Usage
-------------

Eventually there will be example code here showing what I use this package for.
