`hayeslib` is a personal package inspired by Hilary Parker's [Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) post.

# Dear potential employers

This is not what I think a R package should look like. At some point this I will turn the code here into well documented and tested functions. It's probably gonna be a while.

See the `Issues` tab to see what I think this package should look like.

## Installation

You can install `hayeslib` from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexpghayes/hayeslib")
```

## Example Usage

Eventually there will be example code here showing what I use this package for.
